## How to Create a Style Guide

To craft a style guide that ticks all the boxes, here are the steps you’ll take:

### Step 1. Define Your Brand’s Essence

Take the time to research and ponder the defining characteristics of your brand, and then boil it all down into one or two paragraphs. Provide a mission statement, information on your values, and a few key words that will lay the groundwork for all design and content contributions to follow. A great picture can also help easily establish the tone and character of your brand.

### Step 2. Set the Rules of Your Logo

The size, placement, and colors of your logo are paramount in the reflection of your brand. Here is where you will also often see Dos and Don’ts that make it very clear how your company should be visually presented to the world.

### Step 3. Establish the Typography

Typography portrays a very tangible sense of character for your brand. The different sizes of your Headings, the amount of spacing between them, and the style of the typeface all lend a particular tonal quality to your website. You can learn more about establishing your brand’s typography.

### Step 4. Decide on Your Color Palette

Color can be more than just a visual representation of your brand—it can influence your users’ psychology. A certain shade of red could even become less a color and more a subconscious link to a certain soft drink.

### Step 5. Determine the Right Iconography

Icons boil an idea down into immediately accessible graphics. There isn’t much to hide behind; if an icon is even slightly out of kilter it will kill the intended effect. Some icons are more design-heavy than others; this doesn’t make one style better than the other, but they just need to be consistent. Avoid incongruous iconography.

### Step 6. Determine the Right Imagery

What imagery best supports your brand, the vibrant landscape photo or the hand drawn cartoon? Will you represent your company through stock photos, or will you hire a photographer to deliver something unique? Whatever is best for your situation, consider the emotion that your brand wishes to communicate.

### Step 7: Build the Layout and Grid System

This is one where your planning will definitely pay off, as trying to create future page layouts without a reference usually takes a ridiculous amount of time. Remember to keep the layout fluid for multiple screen sizes.

### Step 8: Style the Elements

Depending on the scope of your website, you may have hundreds of separate elements to take into consideration, from videos to blog comments to ecommerce items. Here are some of the most common ones, which will no doubt be included on any website:

### Forms

It’s not just about the color and size of your input fields and labels; you should also include the text to be displayed in case of successful form submission, error, or alert messages.

### Buttons

Your color palette and typography will take care of much of these. The color and sizing of your buttons can signify various things: there are button links, submit buttons, CTA buttons, cancel buttons, menu buttons, and so on.

### Menus

Again, much of what you’ve already established will get you most of the way here. Spacing and text alignment are major styles to specify. Will your logo act as a Home button? Do you ditch the familiar “hamburger icon” for something more creative?

### Modals

A good style guide will not only show the design of your modals (or pop-ups), but it will also stipulate the conditions for their appearance. What actions must a user take in order to see the modal? How is the modal going to persuade action from the user?

### Interaction and Animation Effects

Believe it or not, your brand can be expressed in details even as minute as the milliseconds of a hover effect. A text link with the value { animation: 500ms ease-in; } conveys a different personality and sense of urgency compared to { animation: 100ms linear; }.

A mismatch in animation timing between different links on your website may muddle the user experience, so take the time to plan what message your animations and interactions relay and stick to those rules.
